## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

The first question that comes to mind is: How well can we predict the listing prices ? 

The second question is a related one which is: Which attributes correlate the most with the price of the listing? 

The third question is: Can we find a specific distribution of price changes during a whole calendar year ? 

The Fourth quation is: What are the similarities and differences between the Boston and Seattle Data? 

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 2 notebooks available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  Each of the notebooks is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>
